Meeting-scheduler-application Usage documentation

This is a meeting scheduler application for one meeting room.

One meeting can take only 1 hour and obtain one cell in the “Calendar”.

There is a team of several people that can take part in the meetings. You can see all meetings scheduled for the meeting room or filter meetings by person.

To create new meeting - click “New Event+” button. This will open the modal window. Then you should fill in the form (write a title, choose day, time and participants) and click Submit.

Note:

- All form fields are required. 
- Title must be unique.
- The meeting can be successfully created if and only if the time slot for that day and time is free. 

The “Drag-n-Drop” feature allows you to click on any event in your Calendar and drag that event using your mouse from one day to another, from one time to another.

In order to delete a meeting you have to click the delete icon near the meeting title at “Calendar” screen and then confirm this action in a confirmation dialog.
