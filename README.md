This is a meeting scheduler application for one meeting room. One meeting can
take only 1 hour and obtain one cell in the “Calendar”.

There is a team of several people that can take part in the meetings. You can
see all meetings scheduled for the meeting room or filter meetings by person.

To create new meeting click “New Event+” button. This will open the modal
window. Then you should fill in the form (write a title, choose day, time and
participants) and click Submit.

Note: All form fields are required. The meeting can be successfully created if
and only if the time slot for that day and time is free.

In order to delete a meeting you have to click the delete icon near the meeting
title at “Calendar” screen and then confirm this action in a confirmation
dialog.
